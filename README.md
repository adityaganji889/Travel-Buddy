# Travel Buddy

A project that helps solo travellers travel together with people having similar interests, destinations, hobbies, etc. It also assists the travellers in knowing the location's important aspects, like food, temples, etc. Further, there is also group booking for the travellers, where the travellers can book a hotel or event as a group. The web app also supports the language translation feature, which will convert the app's language to their native language. There is also speech-based navigation, which helps users who are unaware of the technology. There is also a chatbot that assists with Q&A. Furthermore, the mobile app also has a feature of Bluetooth connectivity, which will assist when there is a low network connection, such as in crowded places or remote areas. This feature will allow users to connect with others using the same app via Bluetooth.
